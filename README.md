# generalCultureGame
This is my first project, which I created in 2017. It only contains C #.

The project involves a page that has two general culture tests in Romanian. The first test is about the IT field and the second about the history of Romania.

Each question has several answers, so the test is of the grid type, the user must select what is correct. 

In the end, the game displays the obtained score, and then the player can write his result in a file.
